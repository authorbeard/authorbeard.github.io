Welcome to the personal site of Michael Nolan, full-stack developer, editor, writer, copywriter (ask me what the difference is and I'll give you like, ten minutes of material easy) and problem-solver. And other stuff, but that's not all that interesting. 

Much of the styling and ideas here come from Scotch's Jekyll Bootstrap theme, which you can (read about here)[https://scotch.io/tutorials/getting-started-with-jekyll-plus-a-free-bootstrap-3-starter-theme] and (get the code for here)[https://github.com/scotch-io/scotch-io.github.io/tree/master/_sass/bootstrap/mixins]. Many thanks to the Scotch team for getting me started. 

I tried Jekyll when I'd just started learning web development and it baffled me, so I had a pretty skeletal site here that never looked very good. Since I just needed somewhere to stick text, I (started a basic Wordpress site)[http://hamwater.wordpress.com]. I'll be migrating all those posts over here eventually. But for now, that's where a lot of my blogging about learning to code and projects I'm building all resides. 

Thanks for checking it out. Have a good one.
