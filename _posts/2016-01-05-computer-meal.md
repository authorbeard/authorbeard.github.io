Probably not the best moment to start this blog. But then figuring out when that would be can be added to the array of skills I don’t have. 

```ruby
skills_I_lack = Array.new(1000000000, [])  
skills_I_lack[45568] << best_time_to_start_blog
```

There. I wrote that out in Ruby. Sort of. I also stole that from someone on Slack. (if yer in L-V and you wrote that, sorry for the lack of attribution. It was a rough day.) So I guess I’ve learned something. But of late, what I’m thinking instead isn’t, “Hey, I’m making progress on Ruby, and by extension, becoming a programmer.” No, instead it’s, “Welp, this ain’t working out, either. End of the line for me, boyo. Didn’t I see that the Home Depot near me is hiring?”

Or, “I’m too old to learn to program.” 

Or, “It’s too late for a career switch, even if my old one might as well be dying (since I hate what it’s becoming).”

Or, “Be honest, boyo, you didn’t have a career. You wanna write novels the kind of novels you want to write. Turns out thems the kinds nobody wants to read. What else you gonna do?”

I’m also, for the record, having anxiety dreams about being unmasked as a fraud at coding and, by extension, life itself. 

All from some mthrfckng Tic Tac goddamned Toe. 

You know what? Maybe the problem is Tuesday nights. Never could get the hang of those. 

Regardless, I’m about two months into <a href="http://learn.co">Learn-Verified</a>, the offsite/remote/self-paced version of <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School’s</a> full-stack web development track, and frankly, right now, I think I’m lucky that I can check my email without accidentally breaking my computer or, I dunno, launching an ICBM. I sense, rising before me, the same universe of horrors that seemed to confront my mother when her computer presented her with an error message. She'd refuse to even touch the damn thing. Now she's all over social media [Update: and just installed and mastered AirBNB, including booking a room near me for a visit, in the space of like an hour or two.].

So I guess, no, okay, it’s not that bad. It’s not fear of breaking something, or intimidation. I’m not afraid of computers. Fuck a computer, man. 

Maybe it’s just simple ignorance, which is easy (but often painful) to fix. That’s a linear thing, more or less: you just add gnorance, and Bob’s yer uncle. Simple. Maybe not easy, but simple. 

Assuming you actually can add that gnorance. That's the rub. My brain might not have the right ... I dunno, insert a joke here about ports or something. Like all I gots is parallel ports and I need FireWire. Some shit like that. 

I mean right now, as I read about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax">Minimax</a> and ponder flying out to California to punch my friend the economist, who works a lot with shit like Minimax and recommended I become a developer, it feels like it’s something else entirely. Like I’m beset with a brain that can’t be made to incorporate this knowledge in any useful way. Like I could memorize all of the documentation for Ruby, memorize every blog post and StackOverflow question/answer, memorize all of Github and still, if you asked me to build you a simple static webpage with two goddamned pictures on it, I might have an aneurysm and certainly wouldn’t even know where to begin. 

So it’s fear. Not of computers, but of failure. Not even of failure so much as unworthiness. Of being unable to even give a credible effort, let alone achieve any kind of results. I'm not doing this for shits & grins, bub. I mean, I'm enjoying the hell out of most of it, but that's not good enough. if that's all I wanted, I'd just play PS4 all day or finally get my Spanish passable. And there are a lot of end results that would be, at minimum, acceptable. Lots and lots would be quite pleasant and still leave me well short of the title of King of All Computers. I’m afraid I won’t even be able to cross the minimum threshold. That, in the end, I’ll wind up with nothing to show for this, on top of what feels, at times like these, a decade-plus with nothing to show for it (it's not true; I got some bomb-ass stories, at the very least). 

But right now, it's like all signs are telling me that I just won’t be up to it. 

So it—well, hang on … Shit yes, that’s right: I woke up this morning and at least got my TicTacToe game to work in three different modes, and thought the computer players aren’t especially bright, they’re at least no longer just reading through the underlying array and picking the next unocccupied space. And the program even interacts a little bit and heaps some abuse on players here and there. 

Shit, six weeks ago, give or take, I had no idea where to write the code you wanted to execute so you could, you know, save it and run it later. I was pleased as all hell when I got Codecademy's IRB window (or whatever it is) to run a program that went through some Drake & Wu-Tang lyrics and inserted my cat's name every time they said <a href="https://youtu.be/dF1NUposXVQ">this one word I don't wanna say here.</a> 

Shit, even with this goddamned Tic Tac Toe, the first time I tried to write it (for my first bootcamp application), I looked at a bunch of other code, saw these things called Classes that seemed useful, then got absolutely nowhere with them. So I guess fuck a computer, I'm learning anyway, even if "learning" here just amounts to, "moving on to the next humiliation."

And anyways, rspec's not bleeding all over my terminal like before. I mean, I'm passing 52 of 52 tests here. 

Know what? Fuckit, I'ma take a walk, maybe grab a beer, do some thinking. 

Of course I got dozens of failures ahead of me. But that's no big deal, at least when it comes to failed builds. As long as I keep getting new ones, I'll figure it out. I can figure this shit out. Fear is always gonna be riding shotgun. I wanna get cute and say I pair-program with a demon built of terror and self-doubt, but I'm not gonna. But that's because I wanna scuttle back to a comfort zone, and it turns out writing florid, embarrassing prose is one of the neighborhoods in that zone (it's a hemisphere, brother).
And fuck that, I'm here to learn. So it's gonna hurt a little, and humiliate a lot, and the tingle tells me it's working. Yeah, I'm too old to go back to school, and I'm too old to learn to program, and it's too late for me and I missed all teh boats when it comes to computers & junk. 

But fuckit, I'ma fail a little better next time. And then fail a little better the time after that.

And yeah, that's a low-quality bastardization of a Samuel Beckett quote (look, <a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/s/samuelbeck121335.html">here it is pasted onto a picture of some nature and shit, all inspirational bullshitty-like</a>). But fuckit. If necessary, fuck Beckett.   

And fuck a computer, man.
