I’m about to start my final project. Actually, I’ve started it already, except I haven’t written a line of code yet, so I tell myself I haven’t started. It’s something I do to myself—if I’m in one mood, I’ll spin that as, I dunno, a way to keep myself from cheating. Something along the lines of “Nulla dies sine linea.”

In another mood, it looks like something I’d call Maslow’s treadmill for, probably, all the wrong reasons. I haven’t read Maslow. Just heard about his pyramid once, read a bit of the Wikipedia entry as it stood maybe eight or so years ago, figured it’d work as a red-herring side joke in a short story I was writing: The main character had just survived some traumatic years and found himself approaching happiness, albeit from a direction he’d never imagined would please him. All bewildering, especially this tiny life full of silence. He had a small and very stupid dog that only attacked innocuous birds, and only noticed them long after they’d finished their business. He called the dog Maslow.

It wasn’t a very profound idea, and it wasn’t meant to be. It was supposed to look cute as a dead giveaway that it was a stupid joke—and, secondarily, to bait readers who approach fiction with malice aforethought (e.g., critical theory) into thinking I was seriously trying to be clever.

So I guess that mood is kind of perverse. All I’d really mean, though, is that I have a big task ahead of me that I’ve broken into a lot of smaller units, each with a milepost or two. Only the next one means anything. As soon as it stops being the next one, it ceases to matter. And so that leads to feeling like I’ve not done anything at all. I’ll need to keep an eye on that, probably. Could lead to unnecessarily negative outcomes.

I’m in neither one of those moods today, though. And I swear to you I’m not going to talk much more about my moods. I’m not that interesting. Which is a bummer, because, when all I wanted to do was write and couldn’t come up with much of anything, I read somewhere that, if “Write what you know” isn’t working for you because you don’t know anything, then go do something interesting so you got something to write about.

Which is, frankly, why I wasn’t quite as miserable as I probably should have been that time I picked up food poisoning in Kuala Lumpur, just before a flight to Bangkok, that wound up landing me in the hospital after about 36-60 of the most disgusting hours of my life. Some interesting stuff happened. I nearly soiled the footwear of a man holding an assault rifle. And I know it was interesting because my wife at the time, while sitting on the bed where I passed the brief intervals between scrambles to the bathroom, found herself compelled to call the U.S. to tell it to the friend who’d introduced us. She had a hard time doing that, though, because she kept breaking down into guffaws. I woulda laughed too, but I was pretty sure I’d lost a vital organ or two already and didn’t wanna let the others out. The friend and I still laugh about it. The wife I sealed away in several hundred pages of prose.

Gaahh, I’m on a tangent. Know what the most rewarding part of my weekend was? I can’t tell you; it’s private. But the second- or third-most was sitting down to Google the name of the actor who played Vigo in Ghostbusters II to win an argument with my fiancee and [finding this article](http://deadspin.com/the-hateful-life-and-spiteful-death-of-the-man-who-was-1737376537), which proved that she won but was so fascinating that it didn’t matter. (I’d been sure it was Christopher Lambert; I was trying to watch The Highlander for the first time but couldn’t pay attention: I mean, the Ladybeard’s half-Spanish but her dad doesn’t sound at <em>all</em> like Sean Connery, so she needs to start answering some questions. And what’s more, going into the movie, I had thought there could be more than one, because I’m an ecumenical sort of chap; was fairly gobsmacked to find out I’d got it wrong and there cannot be more than one).

Funny thing is, that all happened an hour or so after I’d completed the last Learn-Verified lesson. Actually after I’d completed the first part of Project Mode. The second part is the final project. I mean … I’m just about done. I really though I’d feel a sense of accomplishment, but I don’t.

What happened to me was Angular happened to me. Or, no—Angular looks like it must be wonderful, especially if you worked in a pre-Angular world doing things that stretched JavaScript as far as it could go. Or even just involved a lot of JavaScript. So what happened to me was I got walloped with tons of front-end processing after spending months going from absolute zero to a serviceable grasp of Rails. And I dunno …

Well, I do know now, at least in part: one of the easter eggs here at the end is figuring out for ourselves how to wire up Angular to Rails. That’s literally what the final assessment specs prescribe. In the JavaScript unit, there was an entire section on that.

So, okay. I’ma need to think on it.

And I couldn’t totally resist thinking about the project, despite giving myself a day to enjoy the parts of my life that aren’t studying as my reward for completing the lessons. Then I woke up at 5a today already sketching out ways I could adapt [my long-running project, Spinner](https://github.com/authorbeard/spinner-rails-assessment"), to meet the specs. Put on the coffee, grabbed a notebook, started poking around with ideas. The good stuff.

So I guess the problem, if there’s a problem, is I’m not feeling inspired. Or I’m not confident in the tradeoffs here. The day I took off and the couple hours I spent this morning thinking and sketching out notes and to-dos and so on let a couple more things slide into place. So that’s a positive thing. But if this is meant to be a showpiece, then maybe I should chase down another idea that might be more interesting to someone other than me. Because as it stands now, Spinner isn’t that. I think it could be, but getting there from here is looking like it’ll take more time than I got right now.

On the other hand, tryna wowing anybody with my technical prowess at the moment doesn’t seem like a real solid goal. Impractical to the point of being counterproductive, I mean.

I’m in need of practice reps, especially with putting all the pieces of things together. So there’s value in keeping on with the same hobby horse: Seeing how the same concept changed as I applied first Sinatra then Rails to it, then added JavaScript, Jquery, OAuth, an external API integration, Figaro, Paperclip, ActiveModelSerializer and some Bootstrap styling has clarified a lot of things for me. It’s helped solidify the foundations. Whizz-bangery can wait for now. Before I even started this, as a Sinatra app, I spent a lot of time thinking about how to structure my data. That was valuable, but I’ve also returned to the data structure several times as I’ve come to understand how things fit together.

And I think at this point, having passed what I thought was the worst-case scenario timeframe about two months ago, any project I land on is going to be a lot more about determination and grind than it will be about inspiration.

But I dunno; I guess I’d expected to be a lot more satisfied at this point.

And now that I look at that, I’m not sure why. As soon as I accomplish one thing, the goalposts move on to the next. Always been that way. Just these expectations coming from the ether.

Times like these are why I got a DMZ between what I need to do and how I feel about doing it. So the lack of inspiration can be put up on a shelf with the weather: It’s there, I feel it, but it’s nothing to keep me from getting to work.

I don’t know why I’m telling you this, Internet, but I have maybe a couple theories and at the moment there’s some value to me in thinking through them a little. Keep ‘em from fermenting and getting in the way later.

Besides, it can be motivating. Hell, it was barely an hour after finishing that last Angular lesson, feeling like I’d just had my ass handed to me for about the fifteenth consecutive day—without so much as a moral victory along the way—when I realized the only real problem here was that expectation I mentioned. I dunno where it came from. I can’t vouch for it. Why’m I letting it get me down? And hell, the web’s full of documentation and instruction and code examples. This shit ain’t magic. Fuckit, then, I’ma figure it out eventually. I just need to regroup.

And actually, that night was the first time I slept for more than six hours, at least under normal operating conditions, in probably six months. So that’s something.

Anyway, so theory one about why I’m telling you is that writing is just another form of thinking, as far as I’m concerned; it’s not a distinct thing, a simple content-delivery service.

Theory two is, at the moment, a kind of unformulated thing. Maybe a gut feeling. Maybe the edges of a melody. I wonder if songwriters ever find themselves with a kind of shapeless cloud in their head that’s just the other side of noise. And then they have to start making their own noises until they the find one with the right waveform to draw out bits and pieces of the other thing. I’m pretty sure Tom Waits has said this is precisely how he writes music these days. Then again, I heard he’s actually a capuchin monkey that a rogue scientist at the Naval Research Center in Point Loma overdosed on HGH and piano lessons. You see, for about six months in the middle of the last century, the U.S. actually wasn’t fighting a war anywhere, so there wasn’t much to do and it was hard to earn your stripes. But you could still land a nice Rear-Admiralship if you got up to something that could make for a good presentation deck—the guys who hand them shits out were bored, too. Appreciated some good entertainment. The guy who came up with MK Ultra, actually, was after precisely this. Only he got so many belly-laughs from the top brass that they gave him his own personal aircraft carrier. Actually lived on it, was granted sovereignty, had an embassy in Virginia Beach. Got sunk in a hurricane in 1973, but it didn’t make the news because of Watergate.

But so I was saying, there’s an unformulated thing, with undertones of anxiety and dread, that’s also out there. It’s neither anxiety nor dread anymore than X wine with Y and Z flavor notes is actually liquefied Y and Z. <a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/">I think this article</a>, which I was just reading on my lunch break and which made me decide to pound thisahere post out, got right to the heart of it. Not that my life resembles the author’s in much of any way, but there’s something in the emotional rhythm of the thing that I recognize. And also in a couple of lines that kind of made me wince. To wit:

“it’s harder to find a good copywriter than a liberal-arts graduate with a degree in history and twelve weeks’ training from an uncredentialed coding dojo.”

I mean, ouch. That description doesn’t apply to Flatiron School, and I’ve done a lot more than 12 weeks here, and gone fairly in-depth, as green as I still am. But I know from my pre-application research that there are, at minimum, murmurs about bootcamps. Given my uncertainty about how my skills at present stack up against other candidates, I worry about this kind of thinking becoming conventional wisdom—which is at the very least a near cousin of superstition. 

I’ve got a solid track record of being given a shot and, in six weeks or so, earning a significantly expanded role. I learn and grow quickly on the job. That can be tricky to communicate, though; it might not even be of much value, I dunno. And I've gotten a lot of benefit out of doing this project in four different iterations. But I got my doubts that anybody's gonna sit down and compare four sets of code.

Anyway. I'm getting anxious about getting that shot in the first place, and I think Wiener's article (<a href="https://nplusonemag.com/issue-25/on-the-fringe/uncanny-valley/">I'ma link it again; it's a great piece</a>) gave shape to a lot of my concerns. So the thing about bootcamps—if they start getting a bum rap across the board—hit a nerve. It wasn't the last, by any means.



I even got a little winsome: I read that article and I wished for a minute that I could find someone who was also willing to pay for it shared her (and my) opinion that it’s hard to find a good copywriter. Or at least someone who thought good writing of any sort was important. Or valuable. And recognized it's more than slapping some text together. Place like that might also realize it takes more than one person. I might could get editing work that didn't make me want to give myself a lobotomy. 

Then I figure what I need to do is stop worrying about this shit and get to work building something. It all yields worthwhile experience at this point. 

This paragraph cheered me up in a kind of making-lemonade, yer-not-alone kind of way: 

>“Venture capitalists have spearheaded massive innovation in the past few decades, not least of which is their incubation of this generation’s very worst prose style. The internet is choked with blindly ambitious and professionally inexperienced men giving each other anecdote-based instruction and bullet-point advice. 10 Essential Start-up Lessons You Won’t Learn in School. 10 Things Every Successful Entrepreneur Knows. 5 Ways to Stay Humble. Why …”


This too: 

>“Sometimes it feels like everyone is speaking a different language — or the same language, with radically different rules.”

See, this stuff in particular raises the anxiety level as I approach a wholly new kind of job search. Setting aside my hostility toward clickbait (especially when I'm bored and I let it sucker me into some dumbass slide-show), the "same language, with radically different rules" really worries me. 

I can learn the technical skills to at least find something useful to do. I know that already. I’m kind of exhausted right now at the far end of Learn-Verified, but I know I can do it. And hell, I spent some of my time off this weekend watching [The Barkley Marathons](http://barkleymovie.com/) after stumbling across it on Netflix. Hadn’t heard tell of this thing before, but the mixture of orneriness, dark humor and endurance there struck a chord somewhere. I mean, that shit’s endurance. I’m not dealing with anything like that. I’m nowhere near my limits yet, at least in terms of what I can figure out how to do. 

So it’s not a matter of wanting to quit. Of finding out my limits here are a lot stricter than I thought. I don't think I'm anywhere near them yet, at least right here.

But it’s that “the same language, with radically different rules” thing that gets me. Known for a long time that I can control, at best, only what I write. I have next to none over what then gets read. Which is fine; that alone, even if I was good at fiction, might preclude any sales, but that forced me to take a look at why I bothered writing at all. And I found it was still worth doing anyway. 

Which isn't a humblebrag about being too real or too innovative or any other kind of bullshit. People want something different from their fiction than what I'm giving them? Well, so be it. I want the utter freedom of the page. The terror that comes along with it is invigorating. It brings something out of me.

And when I used to go to parties, I'd sometimes let slip something that I assumed I only thought or felt because I was a weirdo. Often, it was just to break up the boredom by field-testing some half-baked hypothesis that I wanted refined. Anyway, I mostly try to keep that shit under wraps now; weirdness is never very welcome anyway (the people who bark the loudest about liking it are the ones you especially need to watch yourself around). But you never know which combination of innocuous terms has, for the other guy, become something like a directive; you let 'em drop out yer mouth and all of a sudden these scripts start running and a template gets slapped on you and it's virtually certain that even they dunno what data they're binding into it. They're just holding you accountable for it (mind you, I'm not talking about dropping obviously offensive terms here, or being pissed that not everyone loves [REDACTED BECAUSE NOBODY GETS JOKES] as much as I do).

Angular jokes!

I was explaining why I try to keep it under wraps. But I usually wind up letting it slip eventually anyway. Why? Simple: I've had enough of them actually bounce back to me with some form of 'yeah, me too' when I was expecting, 'What? That's crazy talk. Take your crazy talk to crazytown where they speak only crazy talk, crazyballs.' Obviously not all the time, but frequently enough to know that just because I'm not seeing any of myself in any of the things anyone says when they say 'we', it doesn't mean I'm just crazyballs.

And hell, I read Wiener's article without any inkling of an expectation of finding myself identifying with things there.

Oh, but anyway, point being that I probably would have written myself out of job after job if anyone had ever read my other abortive (and really counterproductive) attempts at blogging. Certainly if I'd gotten much of my fiction read. I mean, even if it had been good enough, I got this hostility toward things that dictate terms to art. And politics and religion do nothing but. I choose to blame Issues Writers. It's like they think there's this other thing higher than their writing, which the writing must serve. That's contemptible. But that's also the market. It's like nobody thinks a piece of fiction can have—and this'll be the last dumbass Angular joke—isolate scope, with the "I" there referring to something defined on that controller.



But anyway. In "Uncanny Valley," the article that touched all this off, as Wiener describes one hyper-brothusiastic job-posting after another, not only do they ring some pretty dour bells, they also help her build a cumulative picture, throughout the article, of a kind of deadening sameness, trampled under the weight of a billion exclamation points. 

That's something I’d hoped to escape by just dropping all the copywriting business I’d tried to scavenge up, since I couldn’t muster any kind of enthusiasm, bro- or otherwise. I’m not building a case against any particular company, let alone an entire industry. I’m saying this was the surest signal that it was time for me to do something different, even if it meant a few uncomfortable, difficult months. 

But if true-believership is what it takes, everywhere you go, then I might be in trouble. I suspect it’s a mass adoption of a faulty theory about motivation and productivity. Something about confusing the ability of near-fanatical belief in a company’s mission to draw more out of some people than they would have given otherwise with a kind of universal rule for achieving acceptable minimum thresholds. And then deciding it’s the employee’s own responsibility to inculcate this kind of belief and devotion—which, if you’re an employer, is certainly a more cost-effective and authority-extending way to go about it. I just can’t believe anyone accepts that deal for a damn paycheck. 

I quickly remind myself that, regardless, I need to get back to work building something because, in this case, I still have a long way to go to develop those technical skills. 

Then there’s this meeting with her boss: 

>“He asks us to write down the names of the five smartest people we know, and we dutifully oblige. I look at the list and think about how much I miss my friends back home, how bad I’ve been at returning phone calls and emails, how bloated I’ve become with start-up self-importance, how I’ve stopped making time for what I once held dear. I can feel blood rush to my cheeks.
>
>“OK,” my manager says. “Now tell me: why don’t they work here?””

I hope I’m misreading this, but this sounds like a kind of near-religious belief in the importance of one particular company masquerading as a commitment to finding the best talent. The latter is of course entirely creditable. The other appears mandatory, a kind of indicator, wholly separate from actual, demonstrable performance. A kind of demand that employees dissolve their very selves into this other thing, presented as “bigger than themselves” when it’s really only more populous. 

It’s work-life balance recontextualized as total war. And I think about how much of a relief it was to take a day and a half for myself (I say half; I woke up at 7a Saturday and got to work on my project. I called it finished around 3:45.). I did a deep-dive into Longform. I read about Vigo the Carpathian. I hung out with the woman who agreed to marry me, and made us both happy, despite both of us having had bad first go-rounds with the institution. I watched a documentary I knew nothing about, which tells a story about a thing I have no interest in personally and found myself enthralled. 

In short, I did a wonderful kind of nothing for about 37 hours. Or no—I spent some time doing the living part of life. Right now it makes good sense to push as much as possible aside while I concentrate on acquiring a raft of new skills. It’s rewarding; I've beaten back the stagnation. But it’s also not living, not right now. 

I wouldn’t fault anyone who simply was always drawn to immersing themselves in code as much as I’ve been doing for the past few months. But I also don't buy that</span> that kind of affinity is normative. I get these signals here and there that this is <i>the</i> way to live your life if you want to get anywhere at all. As if anything short of that total devotion indicates a shortage of drive or an unfitness to hold down a job. I mean, when I go in project mode, I can't really rest, even at the point of exhaustion, until I at least have fixed the next problem. So I have that capacity. I just have other things I wanna do sometimes. I want a coding job, at present, to support my life. Not become it. 

But then, because that’s how everything is, work-life balance has become controversial, primarily a soapbox. Setting aside all the specious political brimstone it spawns, I’ve read no end of brutish, simplistic pronouncements of the kinds I imagine are useful when you’re pushing through your marathon training—only these get presented as philosophically significant insights into the nature of work and productivity. 

And I understand that what's driving this is a search for ways to make people productive. That's fine. That's how I look at myself. But ... well, "same language, radially different rules." Maybe that's all it is; I worry that this implies an unwillingness, inability—maybe even stark refusal—even to entertain the thought that you've accepted a very specific lexicon and therefore are likely to encounter people who aren't speaking that way. I'm worrying I'm gonna be misunderstood yet again. Given the stakes, the temptation usually is to speak as little as possible.

But the work/life thing, the true-believer thing ... the inspirational-type versions of this thinking reduce to a kind of expectation that your character is somehow insufficient to the grand stuff of holding down a job—any job—if you even consider work and life two separate things in a zero-sum system. And I think I get the sources of this kind of belief. I’ve known for more than a decade what makes me happy, and it involves a lot of hard work, frustration, setbacks, pushing through, etc. etc. And it became a natural, inherent part of my life, not something I had to win life back from. And it kept on bringing me that satisfaction even without any prospect of reward. I’d like to be able to retire someday and, like everyone, sooner rather than later. But not so I can just screw around doing nothing. I don’t confuse inactivity with leisure. I want to go back to doing things like writing, and never have to spend time doing work that isn’t my own priority. No matter how good the job, if I’m working for someone else, large parts of my time will be organized according to their priorities. That’s not any kind of problem; that’s a job. And it’s fine. But I’m bewildered at how common it seems to encounter people who don’t make the distinction; still more by people who think it’s somehow suspect to be aware of it. Hell, if I wasn’t helping them achieve their priorities, I don’t know how I’d come to demand compensation for it. 

Might be just a matter of finding the company out there doing something I find enthralling. And maybe those exist now. That’s certainly how I’m gonna focus my job search when I turn my attention to it full-time. But there’s almost certainly ten times as many jobs that don’t fit that description—this simply are never going to become a part of my life in a way that doesn't really require all that much balance—but would still be entirely fine. I don’t buy the argument that the fanatical are going to be more productive than I would be. The belief side of things is just an additional kind of compensation. It doesn’t figure into my motivation very much.

But then here’s where I’m reminded of the entire solar systems of bu- err, nonsense that I’ve heard about that compensation thing. Like the compensation somehow sullies the entire activity. 

Work is very weird, at least in this country. Maybe everywhere, I dunno. 

And anyway, I’ve known for a long time that things that are hard, time-consuming and not necessarily outwardly rewarding can pull things out of me that, at the outset, I doubted I had in me. With writing, I committed to it and, as a result, got better at it and started achieving some of the goals I set for myself. 

With work—that is, doing things other people think are important, because you need money and they’ll pay you for the help—it seems, at minimum, distasteful to mention that not everything you do for a paycheck comes anywhere close to the kind of significance that I get from writing and other people get from other things. That bewilders me. As nice as it would be to get a paycheck from something that <i>did</i> bring me that kind of satisfaction, and as much as I’m keeping my antennae up for those kinds of positions, there are about a dozen million different ways that an entire career can fall short of this standard and still be utterly good. And still receive a person’s best stuff. 

It’s like everyone needs transportation but nobody’ll sell you so much as a damn burro until you swear on your firstborn that it’s a unicorn. 

But then it’s either a different language, or the same language with radically different rules. I keep returning to religion, especially when things look like they run on these terms. 

I wonder what signifiers people are looking for, and why, because it’s a language that does not mean what the words seem to mean otherwise. Or, if they aren’t, in fact, demanding a fanatical, total devotion, then why even use that type of rhetoric? 

I start wondering if it’s some response, on some aggregate level, to the abstraction of most work—something to do with that stuff you hear people talk about where they fret over not being able to hold their work product in their hands at the end of the day. If it's just that some kind of similar concern is also common among the people currently most suited to obtaining positions of authority in tech jobs (or maybe the entire corporate world, and it's just bleeding over into startups with big ambitions). If they must propose the existence of these more rarefied, spiritual rewards to take the place of, say, the solidity of a well-built shelf or the marvel of chemical engineering and artistry that is a well-made cocktail. If it’s just some kind of memory leak for the concept of object orientation. Which that last sentence is nonsense, but what fun's language if you can't play with it?

Then I wonder if it’s simply rare to find people who are themselves professional enough that they don’t need much rah-rah or spiritual hoo-hah to show up every day and give their best stuff. But that starts edging into the territory of making claims about entire populations of people—some more stupid crap about millennials, maybe, or some extraneous indictment of Education, or even broader (and so more ludicrous) claims about the National Character. And nothing of any value ever comes from that kind of thinking. 

I know jobs that can evoke a sense of mission are out there. I doubt very sincerely that I’m the only person for whom earning a living is frequently something different. And I’m certain I’m not the only one for whom that doesn’t mean, by any stretch, that I’m short-changing my employer as a result. 

But still the rhetoric persists. Am I gonna have to just fake it the whole time? Is it just a matter of sitting tight until my right fit shows itself? Am I so fatally bizarre that it's all just not gonna work? I certainly, for all the foregoing, can't really say what's going on. I wind up back where I started: either it's a different language, or it's the same language, but with radically different rules. And it's native to a certain set of personality types, and nobody's giving classes.

Bah, writing this out is good mainly just to excise it. Let the exhaust out so I can go back to ignoring it. These are doubts and fears about an unresolved future with the potential for very negative outcomes and I'm just struggling to assess their probability. I mean, I know all too well that spectacularly negative outcomes are entirely possible for me. Maybe I'm permanently cautious because I should have died from pneumonia when I was twenty-six, and that happened when I was doing it all right, doing better than I'd ever done before.

Then again, I don't worry that much about getting hit by a bus, and that can also happen at any given moment.

All this from one article. What’s going on is that I’m starting to gear up again for the business of job-hunting, and reexamining how I think about work. Part of that means examining things I hadn’t examined before. Part means discarding the things that I have, in favor of something better. And all of it means reconsidering things about how I want my life to go that I’d rather not have to reexamine again. Things take on outsized significance because I'm still unwinding all the parts of me I let become identified with writing, which I've set aside, by and large. 

I’ll tell you another one of the benefits of turning my attention to coding: I’ve realized that I’ve had quite enough, for now, of devoting myself to something that does not appear to have any value for anyone else. The anxiety comes from the stakes—I need a job for all the pragmatic, daily-grind reasons. But it’s positive because I’m sure I’m on to something I can do in ways that provide value for other people. It’s gonna be a tremendous good thing when I can get to doing that. I'm fine with, for now, only being able to provide a little bit of that value. I'll improve. And it’s not gonna take much by way of glamour from that position—or that company—to give me that satisfaction. It won’t take any at all, even. And I just read about some of the legitimately amazing things going on in agriculture; go figure: I might could wind up going from trying to stay 1,000 miles from the Midwest at all times to happily working for, say, John Deere, in under a decade. 

Life, bruh.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>

But that article. Anna Weiner, the author, builds and maintains this wonderfully nuanced, evolving (or at least undulating) emotional tone, something meditative and faceted but unitary just the same. And it hits beats I know from my own experience. She describes a specific life I’ve never lived and probably don’t even want to. We’re not peas in a pod. But it’s intelligible to me. I’ve had my versions of some of these things. This is what drew me to writing and has kept me coming back ever since. 

And it’s kind of dispiriting. The article, I mean. It sounds like she kind of crapped out of Silicon Valley because of not much more than falling foul of a shared meta-opinion about personality types and how to diagnose and value them. A little more (I’ll get to that) but not much more. It obviously hurts. And I can’t see that she did anything wrong. It’s not pity that I feel for her, still less that she’s seeking. But it was clearly something that she wanted to be a part of, and she ultimately wasn't let in. I guess I'd say I empathize, but that word's had Ramsay Bolton set on it. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> Still, reading about the “callback to the childhood nausea of being left out” caused a wince I didn't expect.</span>

I read this piece waiting for the inevitable bit of self-important Cultural Comment that taints just about every long-form piece sooner or later (I think the New Yorker must, by now, just have a script running in its servers somewhere that farts in some BigThink after every fifth paragraph, and probably a couple hundred thousand words dispersed throughout its archive that reel out genteelly forlorn commentary on this automation, all noblesse oblige and abuse of the first-person plural). 

But she doesn't resort to that kind of ersatz profundity. That’s why the emotional beats and facets here are so interesting; it’s not primarily a narrative, let alone a case. The ambivalence here is the story. But obviously the “callback to the childhood nausea of being left out” that she experiences on leaving Silicon Valley relates to the impenetrability of the world she resided in but was not, ultimately, “down for.” 

I think I'd be in the wrong if I didn't acknowledge how that involved her gender in ways that, frankly, it astonishes me that anyone would ever think were appropriate. Actually, what astonishes me is that people make it to adulthood, and then into jobs requiring sophisticated skills, without having picked up along the way that you don’t treat people like this. It shouldn’t even take any particular set of beliefs—religious, political or otherwise—to make this clear. Maybe work-life balance ain’t such a bad thing after all. But then again, I’m only ever amazed these days at the new ways people find of being horrible. Add this one to the pile. 

Make a man want to buy a damn mountain and go live on top of it. 

But I don’t need to belabor those points unless I’m real hot for you to think I’m a Good Guy. And I dunno, man … if you need me to Make a Statement in order to remove me from suspicion, then yer the one with the problem. 

The parts of Wiener’s story that I’m more concerned about just now—the parts that compelled me to think about them at length at this moment—are the parts where I think I resemble her a lot more closely. After all, to choose just one example, I can’t imagine getting hit on at work. People are usually too intimidated by the volcanic sensuality of my beard to even approach.<span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>

But still, it sounds like the only thing she ever did wrong was have a certain personality type. So I wonder what that says about my prospects. Maybe I'm tryna join a pod of dolphins and I'm the only one who doesn't know I'm an ottoman. 

It must be just me struggling to figure out the absence of the feelings of relief and accomplishment that I’d expected to encounter here. There’s something with undertones of dread and anxiety—but which really isn’t either one—sitting on me instead. Or, no, that’s not quite right: it is composed in part of anxiety. Mostly simple stuff about the uncertainty of my future right now. So mostly surface level. I’ve looked into it, and I don’t think it’s very serious. 

The only part that might be significant is that the main thing, beyond technical proficiency, that I don’t share with the much-lamented codebros (at least—and this is an important caveat—as they’ve been described; I don’t know any), is the excitability. I have a high threshold for enthusiasm; it’s a slow burn and, anyway, always seems to be beside the point when there’s a job to get done. In a pinch, I can always point to my Midwesternity to explain how hard it is to get me to express a lot of enthusiasm one way or another.

I worry sometimes that this will leave me well and truly fucked if it really is, all the way down, a matter of cause-joining and -being-down-for. I’ve had only, at best, the slightest whiffs of being a part of a company that did something truly good in some sense (and—referencing my Midwesternity again—I have a real affection for the eminently pragmatic, so I’m not just talking about a company’s social mission or political bent when I talk about doing something truly good). I imagine it’d be pretty damned good to be a part of, and I’d get enthusiastic. 

But it would have to be in that order. I take some convincing before I get hyped up. But I go to work and I work hard as soon as I got a job to work at. Maybe errbody else does it different. I doubt I'm that special. And I hope that I don’t have to want every one of the same things out of work as everyone else in order to get that work; I don't need a sense of mission, of righting wrongs, of laying the foundations of a better world. That's nice stuff; it's also icing on the gravy. 

“The tenor of these events is usually the same: guilelessly optimistic,” Wiener writes of some Valley party or product launch or something. 

Well. My optimism’s always guarded. For very good reasons. And the “blindly ambitious” guys exchanging career advice? Mine got its eyesight a decade ago. I’m not sure I’m better off for it, but I’m certain that if you wanna argue the other kind’s better, you gotta make a case for it. 

Know what? I'm doing this to myself. I'm exhausted and got some pre-project jitters. They'll go away as soon as I rails g. 

But I'm a little worn out right now. So I’m gonna enjoy this a little more. 

I’ma stretch out and, for a couple more minutes, enjoy this vacation back among the things I used to love. It’s good that I’ve given my mind over entirely to learning this new thing for awhile. But I need some of that space back right now. 

Or, hang on … damn. I just remembered how much I disliked the stubbed-out HTML construction in the JavaScript parts of Spinner that parse the data I get from my API integration. And realized that Angular offers a much better and actually more intelligible/readable way to do this that could make some of the ugliness in the styling (or the near-absence thereof, if I’m honest) much easier to play around with later. And it’s time to just drop the HTML routes that I had. I can do all of the stuff I was going to do with those much easier and faster once I figure out a couple more things about the digest cycle so I can fire off API requests to my own back end. And rereading that sentence makes me want to giggle because, even if I’m not a child, I used to be one and it wasn’t all bad. 

Actually, I think I can knock the basics out pretty quickly, in one or two decent sprints. And I know I can do one or two more things I’ve been wanting to do that I think will be pretty cool. I won’t make money off of this thing directly, but fuckit, I’m doing it for the experience, and I’m thinking Angular might start opening up to me a little bit pretty soon. 

In fact, you know what? I’ma rails g a new app altogether, set up the database to handle some of the information I’ve been ignoring thus far, clear the decks of some of the orphan code so I can write more. 

I’m about to start my final project. Actually, I’ve started already, except I haven’t written a line of code yet, so I can talk it over with myself and think through the problems I’d otherwise code up for myself. 

It’s gonna be a good week, I think.
